<P>
The Frequently Asked Ones are not on this page, since there is an excellent FAQ section <BR>
on William Stearns freedups page
<A HREF="http://www.stearns.org/freedups/README">http://www.stearns.org/freedups/README</A><BR>
Please note, that freedup is a completely independant implementation,
with other means and other capabilities.<BR>
 The Main difference is the 
ability of freedup to provide symlinks from different file systems.

However, I hope the Japanese and Czech comments are positive. I am fortunate to tell, there are currently no unresolved bug reports.

A lot of different web sites were helpful</A>.
I used William Stearns <A HREF="http://www.stearns.org/freedups/">freedups</A> for many years quite successfully until I lacked some features, which freedup fixes.
<P>
Thanks for compiling and publishing to

Thanks to <A HREF="http://www.heise.de/ct/07/24/154/">Thorsten Leemhuis and c't (24/2007) on writing and publishing "Auswahl satt"</A>, which is a German article about "System-Utlities f&uuml;r Linux", which covers these
topics: file managers, sorting & finding, and archiving files. 
Freedup was his choice to find and link duplicate files.
<P>
Thanks to <A HREF="http://www.heise.de/ix/artikel/2007/11/153/">Michael Riepe and iX (11/2007) on writing and publishing "Entdoppeltes Lottchen"</A>, which is a German article about "Dateien mit gleichem Inhalt finden und beseitigen". He spent one third of the article on freedup (counting paragraphs).
<P>
My thanks to all the individuals who were asking me for certain improvements or corrections. 
This raised the usability of Freedup and therefore helped them, others and me.
